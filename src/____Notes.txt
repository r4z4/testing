- Not sure if way I am using class name and/or IDs for HTML elements
is the best.  Doing document.querySelector() to get elements by class,
but thinking using document.getElementById() is better.  For CSS of buttons
just styled it all under button {} with no class, which works for now.

- Can probably abstract out all the "document.querySelector" to a variable
or constant to use (use $ to be like jQuery?)
